# Banana-Republic

Project on making a simple clicker game
Adding the requirements as a reminder.
ðŸŽ¯ Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
ðŸŽ¯ Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
ðŸŽ¯ Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
ðŸŽ¯ Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
ðŸŽ¯ Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

Completed the inital skeleton. Need to go away and think of my layout and how I want to structure the script.

- inital want to change names of items in the shop but first need to actually work out if thats possible to do the API.
- look up local storage again - want to make sure I can confirm what I want to do.
- MEDIA QURIES - I need to work them out.
- Write down my structure and my plan on paper - can change on the fly.
  Just remember Rocky

Spent some time planning how i want my page to look, I ahve all the elements I need in place and an image need to change font and some minor styling but will do for now. Shock since I planned it went a lot smoother than before. Also added a simple counter - bit janky need to fix but does the basics. Need to plan my code again properly. Overall good start I think.

Going to watch Rocky now...
