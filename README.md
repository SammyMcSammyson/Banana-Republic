# Banana-Republic

Project on making a simple clicker game
Adding the requirements as a reminder.
ðŸŽ¯ Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
ðŸŽ¯ Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
ðŸŽ¯ Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
ðŸŽ¯ Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
ðŸŽ¯ Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

Completed the inital skeleton. Need to go away and think of my layout and how I want to structure the script.

- inital want to change names of items in the shop but first need to actually work out if thats possible to do the API.
- look up local storage again - want to make sure I can confirm what I want to do.
- MEDIA QURIES - I need to work them out.
- Write down my structure and my plan on paper - can change on the fly.
  Just remember Rocky

Spent some time planning how i want my page to look, I ahve all the elements I need in place and an image need to change font and some minor styling but will do for now. Shock since I planned it went a lot smoother than before. Also added a simple counter - bit janky need to fix but does the basics. Need to plan my code again properly. Overall good start I think.

Going to watch Rocky now...

Spent all day working on it. Spent time with Manny to work out how API nomcleture works, definitly got my head round it so comfortable now implementing it. Also got my autoclick working with live counter - little bit janky speeds ups massivley when buy things timing issue. Overall the clicker works need to style it a bit more. Also the writing down worked my index.html makes sense and so do my functions since when I showed people they could understand it.

- inital want to change names of items in the shop but first need to actually work out if thats possible to do the API. I can make this work but more important things to do. If i have time will do.
- look up local storage again - want to make sure I can confirm what I want to do. Looked it up more comfortable need to really work on it.
- MEDIA QURIES - I need to work them out.Still no clue hahah. Will read more.
- Write down my structure and my plan on paper - can change on the fly. This works for me. Also allows me to explain things when I am stuck also realised makes changing things on the fly a lot easier.
- Want to style the table better.
- also going to experiment with comments when you hit certain goals the code is relativley easy...(famous last words)
- going better than last week. Having manny and Joe helped alot also ttalking to over people.

Rocky is not really a sports movie...
