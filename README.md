# Banana-Republic

Project on making a simple clicker game
Adding the requirements as a reminder.
🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

setting up my files and following the walk through talk through skeleton. Hvae some ideas of what I want to do need to remember to hit the requirements and plan on paper what I want to do then build!!!

Completed the inital skeleton. Need to go away and think of my layout and how I want to structure the script.

- inital want to change names of items in the shop but first need to actually work out if thats possible to do the API.
- look up local storage again - want to make sure I can confirm what I want to do.
- MEDIA QURIES - I need to work them out.
- Write down my structure and my plan on paper - can change on the fly.
  Just remember Rocky

Spent some time planning how i want my page to look, I ahve all the elements I need in place and an image need to change font and some minor styling but will do for now. Shock since I planned it went a lot smoother than before. Also added a simple counter - bit janky need to fix but does the basics. Need to plan my code again properly. Overall good start I think.

Going to watch Rocky now...

Spent all day working on it. Spent time with Manny to work out how API nomcleture works, definitly got my head round it so comfortable now implementing it. Also got my autoclick working with live counter - little bit janky speeds ups massivley when buy things timing issue. Overall the clicker works need to style it a bit more. Also the writing down worked my index.html makes sense and so do my functions since when I showed people they could understand it.

- inital want to change names of items in the shop but first need to actually work out if thats possible to do the API. I can make this work but more important things to do. If i have time will do.
- look up local storage again - want to make sure I can confirm what I want to do. Looked it up more comfortable need to really work on it.
- MEDIA QURIES - I need to work them out.Still no clue hahah. Will read more.
- Write down my structure and my plan on paper - can change on the fly. This works for me. Also allows me to explain things when I am stuck also realised makes changing things on the fly a lot easier.
- Want to style the table better.
- also going to experiment with comments when you hit certain goals the code is relativley easy...(famous last words)
- going better than last week. Having manny and Joe helped alot also ttalking to over people.

Rocky is not really a sports movie...

Spent a few hours working on it. I have got the basic game down, you can buy stuff, get evertyhing linked and cannot but items if you do not have enough money. I styled the table beter. Also added commments usiing local storage which was nice . Overall I have achived all goals bar media Quieies - still do not get them will read more - there are some changes I want to add

- Local Storage for cookie count data
- Sell buttons - really simple copy code change + to -
- Make my button code into a for each function it is cleaner and allows me to add things
- track how many of each item you have - simple image appearing could work - I have a lot of empty space on the right.

🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count. Yes
🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable. Yes - NOT THE BUTTON CODE THOUGH
🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions. Yes
🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information. Yes for relevant game data not cookie count data
🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM. Yes but my logic I used overall is very different fromm how most people implemented it e.g. having my BpS in my Banana Count variable rather then seperate which works for now but restricts how to build things and causes weird bugs.

🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function. Have not achived yet but have plans
🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects. Have not achived yet but have plans.

<!-- Have now achived this but rather janky will focus on local storage 15/09/2024 1125 -->

🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information. No - you will just get my rambling thoughts.
🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch. Limited knowledge on this but will read up because I tried it a little and it worked.
🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences. Need other items before I even think about this.

Still got some features to add but I am a solid 50% happy with it howver going to run out of time. The project does not interest me - therefore proving the parts that do intrest me is UI/UX I think this is becuase I am creating something with creativity while this we are pretty limited - the process is creative but the product isnt while with UI you get both. Overall it has gone OK I have a base game however if I had to do it all again I would do it very diffrently. Overall a lot easier than last weeks. Writing on paper definitly helped and I look forward to the project. And I am getting more comfortable with functions since I started writing out what I want to acheive. Will not reach a 2 since I cannot get the local storage to work - but I am ok with that - I need to go to the Gym and do some other things. Will be on later but I doubt I will get much done since the improvements require reading and learning rather than using knowledge I already have.
